# Journal 14

I've been trying so hard to figure this stuff out. I'm learning better ways to debug my code to find out what's really going on. I passed out trying to work on things last night and now turning in this stuff a little late. With the extra week, I'm going to be able to get a lot done. Hopefully even be able to go back and do a lot of review. But also be able to get good sleep and try each day at it.
