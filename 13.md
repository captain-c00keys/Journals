# Journal 13

I learned today that I needed to start from scratch. There's a disconnect in my logic on how I look at these problems. I need to go back to the fundamentals. My confidence in this stuff is at a low and to build on that, I need to take studying a step farther. Right now, I'm all in. A lot of my distractions are gone and it's just me against the world. I've asked for a tutor and going to be coming in on the weekends for extra study.
