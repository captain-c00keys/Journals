Gene's learning journal

I've actually been enjoying what I do more. It's taken me a minute to find the confidence in this stuff, but now it's moving along. I do need to catch up on hw though. Tried this weekend but we were stuck working on the chocolate pizza project for 18 hours straight. In due time, I'll get caught up, especially with this extra week of break that we have. I fell asleep while doing my readings on Sunday. I was in codefellows all day Sat and Sun.
