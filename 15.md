# Journal 15

Learned a lot from my tutor session on Saturday. Went through a lot of concepts that just weren't sticking with me. Now, trying to do work on the hw for today. Will take the 300 entrance exam tonite also. This week, I'll be working on watching class videos, and trying to do each project from scratch to see where my gaps in knowledge are.
