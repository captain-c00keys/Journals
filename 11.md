I'm learning quite a bit from this Bus Mall project. It has definietly made my mind take avenues it hasn't turned down since college. Just trying to figure out how to speak to the computer in a way that it will understand what I'm trying to tell it. And how it will work to make my plans come to life. I just need to figure out a basis for what we're learning or a theory so I can use that everytime when solving problems.
